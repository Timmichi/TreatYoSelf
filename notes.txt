Andrew:
    1.) Fix category errors,
            Don't Allow duplicate Categories to be made
            Let Users Create and Delete categories
            ComponentDidMount only called once in life cycle
                This messes up category showing when refreshed

    2.) ComponentDidMount doesn't get called on while re-rendering
    3.) Child ComponentDidMount calls before parents
